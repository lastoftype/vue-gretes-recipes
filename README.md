# vue-gretes-recipes

A Vue.js CLI project that shows off recipes. Adapted from a React project I am working on.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
yarn dev

# build for production with minification
yarn build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
yarn build --report
```

## Run API server

``` bash
# use recipes.json to serve dummy api responses, with proxy on port 5000
yarn server
```

Then run project separately
``` bash
# run app on localhost:8080
yarn dev
```
